What is Azure API Management (APIM)?	A fully managed service that enables organizations to publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs with a gateway, developer portal, and management plane	azure,apim,basics

What are the main components of API Management?	1. API Gateway (proxy for requests), 2. Management plane (configure APIs), 3. Developer portal (documentation and testing)	azure,apim,components

What is the API Gateway in APIM?	The runtime component that accepts API calls, applies policies, and forwards requests to backend services	azure,apim,gateway

What is the Developer Portal in APIM?	Automatically generated, customizable website where API consumers can discover APIs, read documentation, try APIs, and subscribe	azure,apim,developer-portal

What are APIM pricing tiers?	1. Consumption (serverless, pay per call), 2. Developer (non-production), 3. Basic, 4. Standard, 5. Premium (multi-region, VNet)	azure,apim,pricing

When should you use Consumption tier vs Standard tier?	Consumption: Variable traffic, serverless, pay-per-call, no SLA. Standard: Production workloads, consistent traffic, SLA required.	azure,apim,pricing,comparison

What is an API in APIM context?	A set of operations (endpoints) that can be invoked by clients, representing a backend service interface	azure,apim,api

What is an operation in APIM?	An individual endpoint (HTTP method + URL path) within an API, e.g., GET /users, POST /orders	azure,apim,operation

What is a product in APIM?	A packaging of one or more APIs with usage quotas, access controls, and terms of use, published to developers	azure,apim,product

What is the difference between open and protected products?	Open products: accessible without subscription. Protected products: require subscription key for access.	azure,apim,product

What is a subscription in APIM?	A credential (subscription key) that grants access to one or more products/APIs, used for authentication and rate limiting	azure,apim,subscription
