What is Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)?	Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service providing authentication, single sign-on, and application access management	azure,authentication,entra-id,basics

What is the Microsoft identity platform?	A collection of authentication services, libraries (MSAL), and tools for developers to authenticate users and access APIs	azure,authentication,identity-platform

What is OAuth 2.0?	An authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts, using access tokens for API authorization	azure,authentication,oauth

What is the difference between OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect?	OAuth 2.0: Authorization (access delegation). OpenID Connect: Authentication (identity verification) built on OAuth 2.0.	azure,authentication,oauth,oidc

What is an access token?	A credential used to access protected resources (APIs), contains claims about user permissions and scopes, typically short-lived (1 hour)	azure,authentication,tokens

What is an ID token?	A JWT containing claims about user identity (name, email, sub), used for authentication, typically consumed by the client application	azure,authentication,tokens

What is a refresh token?	A long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate, stored securely	azure,authentication,tokens

What is role-based access control (RBAC)?	Authorization model that grants access based on user roles, defining what actions users can perform on resources	azure,authentication,rbac

What is the difference between authentication and authorization?	Authentication: verifying identity (who you are). Authorization: determining permissions (what you can do).	azure,authentication,basics
