What are the main Azure messaging services?	1. Azure Service Bus (enterprise messaging), 2. Azure Queue Storage (simple queuing), 3. Azure Storage Queues (basic queuing)	azure,messaging,basics

What is Azure Service Bus?	A fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics supporting transactions, ordering, and duplicate detection	azure,messaging,service-bus,basics

What is Azure Queue Storage?	A simple, cost-effective queuing service for storing large numbers of messages, accessed via HTTP/HTTPS	azure,messaging,queue-storage,basics

What is the difference between Service Bus and Queue Storage?	Service Bus: enterprise features (transactions, ordering, sessions, TTL). Queue Storage: simple, cost-effective, large messages (up to 64 KB).	azure,messaging,comparison

When should you use Service Bus vs Queue Storage?	Service Bus: guaranteed ordering, transactions, advanced routing, duplicate detection. Queue Storage: simple async messaging, cost-sensitive, large volume.	azure,messaging,comparison

What is a Service Bus queue?	A FIFO message container supporting one or more competing consumers	azure,messaging,service-bus,queue

What is a Service Bus topic?	A publish-subscribe messaging resource allowing multiple independent subscriptions with filtering	azure,messaging,service-bus,topic

What is the difference between Service Bus queues and topics?	Queues: one message to one consumer (point-to-point). Topics: one message to multiple subscribers (pub/sub).	azure,messaging,service-bus,comparison

A system needs to send order notifications to three different processors (inventory, shipping, billing). What Service Bus feature is ideal?	Service Bus topic with three subscriptions - each processor gets a copy of every message	azure,messaging,use-case,service-bus
