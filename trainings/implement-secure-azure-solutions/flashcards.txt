What Key Vault tiers are available?	1. Standard (software-protected keys), 2. Premium (HSM-protected keys for regulatory compliance)	azure,security,key-vault,tiers

When should you use Premium Key Vault tier?	Use Premium when you need HSM (Hardware Security Module) protected keys for regulatory compliance (FIPS 140-2 Level 2)	azure,security,key-vault,premium

What is a Managed Identity?	An automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID that allows Azure resources to authenticate to services without storing credentials in code	azure,security,managed-identity,basics

What are the two types of Managed Identities?	1. System-assigned (lifecycle tied to resource, 1:1), 2. User-assigned (independent lifecycle, reusable across resources)	azure,security,managed-identity

When should you use System-assigned vs User-assigned Managed Identity?	System-assigned: Single resource, simple scenarios, auto-cleanup. User-assigned: Multiple resources, pre-provisioned identity, shared identity requirements.	azure,security,managed-identity

A web app needs to access Key Vault, SQL Database, and Storage Account. What authentication approach is recommended?	Enable Managed Identity on the web app and grant appropriate permissions (RBAC roles) to each resource - no credentials in code	azure,security,use-case,managed-identity

How does Managed Identity authentication work?	App requests token from Azure Instance Metadata Service → Entra ID validates identity → Returns access token → App uses token to access resource	azure,security,managed-identity,authentication

What is Azure App Configuration?	A service for centralized management of application settings and feature flags with support for Key Vault references	azure,security,app-configuration,basics

What can App Configuration store?	1. Key-value pairs (application settings), 2. Feature flags (enable/disable features), 3. Key Vault references (secret references)	azure,security,app-configuration

What is the difference between App Configuration and Key Vault?	App Configuration: non-sensitive settings, feature flags, environment configs. Key Vault: secrets, passwords, certificates, encryption keys.	azure,security,comparison

What is a Key Vault reference in App Configuration?	A special type of setting that stores a URI pointing to a secret in Key Vault, retrieved at runtime using Managed Identity	azure,security,app-configuration,key-vault-reference

A company needs to store database connection strings securely. What's the best practice?	Store connection string in Key Vault, reference it from App Configuration using Key Vault reference, access via Managed Identity	azure,security,use-case,best-practices
