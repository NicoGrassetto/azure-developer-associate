What is a Managed Identity in the context of App Service?	A Managed Identity is an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID that allows App Service to authenticate to Azure services (like Key Vault, Storage, SQL) without storing credentials in code.	azure,app-service,security

A developer needs to test database migrations on a staging environment before applying to production. What App Service features should be used?	Use deployment slots (staging and production) with slot-specific connection strings that stay with each slot during swaps.	azure,app-service,use-case,deployment-slots

What is the maximum number of instances for auto-scaling in the Free tier?	Free tier does not support auto-scaling or manual scale-out (limited to 1 shared instance).	azure,app-service,scaling

What is "warm-up" in the context of deployment slots?	Warm-up is the process where App Service makes HTTP requests to the application root after swapping configuration but before routing production traffic, ensuring the app is ready to serve requests.	azure,app-service,deployment-slots

How can you implement continuous deployment with GitHub in App Service?	Configure GitHub Actions or use the Deployment Center in Azure Portal to connect your GitHub repository. App Service can automatically build and deploy on each push to the specified branch.	azure,app-service,deployment,cicd

What is ZIP Deploy in App Service?	ZIP Deploy is a deployment method that uploads a .zip file containing your application code to App Service using the Kudu REST API. It's fast and doesn't require build steps.	azure,app-service,deployment
