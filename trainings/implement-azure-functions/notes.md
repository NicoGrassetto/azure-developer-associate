# Implement Azure Functions

## Explore Azure Functions
### Introduction
Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it.
### Discover Azure Functions
Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

We often build systems to react to a series of critical events. Whether you're building a web API, responding to database changes, processing IoT data streams, or even managing message queues - every application needs a way to run some code as these events occur.

Azure Functions supports *triggers*, which are ways to start execution of your code, and *bindings*, which are ways to simplify coding for input and output data. There are other integration and automation services in Azure and they all can solve integration problems and automate business processes. They can all define input, actions, conditions, and output.

#### Compare Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps
Both Functions and Logic Apps are Azure Services that enable serverless workloads. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, whereas Azure Logic Apps is a serverless workflow integration platform. Both can create complex *orchestrations*. An orchestration is a collection of functions or steps, called actions in Logic Apps, that are executed to accomplish a complex task.

For Azure Functions, you develop orchestrations by writing code and using the [Durable Functions extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=in-process%2Cnodejs-v3%2Cv1-model&pivots=csharp). For Logic Apps, you create orchestrations by using a GUI or editing configuration files.
