What is Azure Blob Storage?	Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud, optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data like text, binary data, images, videos, and backups.	azure,blob-storage,basics

What are the three types of blobs?	1. Block Blobs (text/binary, up to 190.7 TiB), 2. Append Blobs (append operations, logs, up to 195 GiB), 3. Page Blobs (random read/write, VHDs, up to 8 TiB)	azure,blob-storage,blob-types

When should you use Block Blobs?	Use Block Blobs for text and binary data like documents, images, videos, backups - most common blob type for general file storage	azure,blob-storage,blob-types

When should you use Append Blobs?	Use Append Blobs for scenarios requiring append operations like log files, streaming data, and audit trails where data is only added, not modified	azure,blob-storage,blob-types

When should you use Page Blobs?	Use Page Blobs for random read/write operations, particularly for VHD disks for Azure VMs and database files requiring frequent random access	azure,blob-storage,blob-types

What are the Azure Storage account performance tiers?	1. Standard (HDD-based, general purpose, lower cost), 2. Premium (SSD-based, low latency, high throughput)	azure,blob-storage,performance

What are the blob access tiers?	1. Hot (frequent access, highest storage cost, lowest access cost), 2. Cool (infrequent access, 30-day minimum, lower storage cost), 3. Cold (rarely accessed, 90-day minimum), 4. Archive (offline, 180-day minimum, lowest storage cost, hours to rehydrate)	azure,blob-storage,access-tiers

What is the minimum storage duration for Cool tier?	30 days - early deletion incurs a prorated charge	azure,blob-storage,access-tiers

What is the minimum storage duration for Archive tier?	180 days - early deletion incurs a prorated charge	azure,blob-storage,access-tiers

How long does it take to rehydrate a blob from Archive tier?	Standard priority: less than 15 hours. High priority: less than 1 hour (higher cost)	azure,blob-storage,access-tiers,archive

A company stores security camera footage that must be kept for 1 year but is rarely accessed. What access tier is most cost-effective?	Archive tier - lowest storage cost for rarely accessed data with long retention requirements	azure,blob-storage,use-case,access-tiers

What is blob lifecycle management?	Automated policies that transition blobs between access tiers or delete them based on rules (age, last modified, last accessed) to optimize costs	azure,blob-storage,lifecycle

What actions can lifecycle management policies perform?	1. Transition blobs to cooler tiers, 2. Delete blobs and snapshots, 3. Based on age or last access time	azure,blob-storage,lifecycle

A company wants to automatically move blobs to Cool tier after 30 days and Archive after 90 days. What should be configured?	Blob lifecycle management policy with rules to transition to Cool after 30 days and Archive after 90 days	azure,blob-storage,use-case,lifecycle

What is blob versioning?	Automatic maintenance of previous versions of a blob whenever it's modified or deleted, enabling recovery from accidental changes	azure,blob-storage,versioning

What is soft delete for blobs?	Soft delete retains deleted blobs for a configured retention period (1-365 days), allowing recovery before permanent deletion	azure,blob-storage,soft-delete

What is the difference between blob versioning and soft delete?	Versioning: keeps all versions of modified blobs. Soft delete: retains deleted blobs for recovery. Both provide data protection but for different scenarios.	azure,blob-storage,data-protection

What is blob snapshot?	A read-only copy of a blob at a specific point in time. Snapshots share blocks with base blob until modified, making them storage-efficient.	azure,blob-storage,snapshots

What is immutable storage?	Immutable storage (WORM - Write Once Read Many) prevents blobs from being modified or deleted for a specified retention period, meeting compliance requirements	azure,blob-storage,immutability

What types of immutability policies are available?	1. Time-based retention (legal hold for specified period), 2. Legal hold (indefinite until explicitly removed)	azure,blob-storage,immutability

A financial services company must retain records for 7 years without modification per regulations. What blob feature should be used?	Immutable storage with time-based retention policy set to 7 years	azure,blob-storage,use-case,immutability

What is blob index tags?	Key-value metadata tags that enable finding and managing blobs across containers using queries, separate from traditional metadata	azure,blob-storage,index-tags

What's the difference between blob metadata and index tags?	Metadata: stored with blob, retrieved with blob properties. Index tags: queryable across containers, enabling powerful search and categorization.	azure,blob-storage,index-tags

What is a storage account?	A storage account provides a unique namespace for Azure Storage data, containing blobs, files, queues, and tables with configurable redundancy and access	azure,blob-storage,storage-account

What redundancy options are available for storage accounts?	1. LRS (Locally Redundant), 2. ZRS (Zone Redundant), 3. GRS (Geo-Redundant), 4. RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant), 5. GZRS (Geo-Zone Redundant), 6. RA-GZRS	azure,blob-storage,redundancy

What is the difference between GRS and RA-GRS?	GRS: data replicated to secondary region, readable only after failover. RA-GRS: data in secondary region is readable at all times.	azure,blob-storage,redundancy

A company needs 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability. What redundancy option provides this?	GRS or GZRS provides 16 9's durability by replicating data to a secondary region	azure,blob-storage,redundancy,use-case

What is Shared Access Signature (SAS)?	A URI that grants restricted access to Azure Storage resources with specified permissions and time duration, without sharing account keys	azure,blob-storage,security,sas

What types of SAS are available?	1. User delegation SAS (secured with Azure AD credentials, best security), 2. Service SAS (secured with account key), 3. Account SAS (access to multiple services)	azure,blob-storage,sas

When should you use user delegation SAS over service SAS?	Use user delegation SAS for better security as it uses Azure AD credentials instead of account keys, allowing revocation without key rotation	azure,blob-storage,sas,best-practices

What parameters can be specified in a SAS token?	Permissions (read, write, delete, list), resource (blob, container), start/expiry time, IP address restrictions, protocol (HTTPS only)	azure,blob-storage,sas

A web app needs to allow users to upload images directly to blob storage without backend code. What security mechanism enables this?	Generate a SAS token with write permission for specific blob/container, return to client for direct upload	azure,blob-storage,use-case,sas

What is a stored access policy?	A stored access policy defines SAS constraints at the container level, enabling centralized management and revocation of multiple SAS tokens	azure,blob-storage,sas,stored-policy

What are the advantages of stored access policies?	Allows changing or revoking permissions without regenerating SAS tokens, provides centralized control over access	azure,blob-storage,sas,best-practices

What authentication methods are available for blob storage?	1. Shared Key (account key), 2. Shared Access Signature (SAS), 3. Azure Active Directory (recommended), 4. Anonymous public read access	azure,blob-storage,authentication

What is the recommended authentication method for blob storage?	Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Managed Identities for applications, providing better security without managing keys	azure,blob-storage,authentication,best-practices

What is anonymous public access in blob storage?	Container or blob level public read access without authentication, suitable for public content like images, but disabled by default for security	azure,blob-storage,security

Can you disable anonymous public access at the storage account level?	Yes, you can disallow public access at the storage account level to enforce authentication for all containers and blobs	azure,blob-storage,security

What is Azure Storage Explorer?	A standalone desktop application for managing Azure Storage resources, providing GUI for upload/download/manage blobs, queues, tables, and files	azure,blob-storage,tools

What SDKs are available for Azure Blob Storage?	.NET, Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, C++, and REST API	azure,blob-storage,sdks

What is the blob tier at the account level vs blob level?	Account level: default access tier for new blobs. Blob level: individual blob tier (can override account default)	azure,blob-storage,access-tiers

Can you change a blob's tier after upload?	Yes, using Set Blob Tier operation to change between Hot, Cool, Cold, and Archive tiers	azure,blob-storage,access-tiers

What happens to snapshots when you delete a blob?	By default, deleting a blob fails if snapshots exist. You must explicitly delete snapshots first or include snapshots in the delete operation.	azure,blob-storage,snapshots

What is the difference between blob versioning and snapshots?	Versioning: automatic, maintains all versions. Snapshots: manual, creates specific point-in-time copies. Versioning is more comprehensive.	azure,blob-storage,data-protection
